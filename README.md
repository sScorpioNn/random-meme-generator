This program adds random Russian text to images.

I'm not good at python, so don't judge me. I created this program that adds random text to your images.
Here's some examples:

## How 2:
1. Add an image with the name source.png
2. Run "first.bat"
3. Run "run.bat"
4. That's it, you have an output image "output.png"


Oh yeah, and it only works in Russian
